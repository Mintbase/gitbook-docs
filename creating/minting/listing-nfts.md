#### Price

### Rolling Auction

On the listing page, toggle between **Simple Sale** and **Rolling Auction.** Just as with Simple Sale, you'll first need to decide how many tokens you want to list. Here, rather than selecting a price, you'll need to fix a minimum bid for your auction. Buyers will not be able to bid under your minimum price.&#x20;

Each bid is active for 24hrs. After this, if you don't accept the offer, it will expire. Read more about how auctions work under [auctions.md](../../market/auctions.md "mention").
