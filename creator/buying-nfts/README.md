### What is the process for buying an NFT via Simple Sale?

After finding an NFT listed as a [Simple Sale](buying-as-simple-sale.md), you can see the price in NEAR and the approximated conversion in USD. Click on "Buy with NEAR" and authorize the transaction on your wallet. After the transaction is complete, you can access the Activity page to see your transaction or click on Create and My NFTs to find your new purchase.

### **What is a Rolling Auction and how can I participate?**

A [Rolling Auction](buying-as-rolling-auction.md) is a type of auction where you can make an offer on an NFT. After you make an offer, it stays locked in the contract for 24 hours. During this time, the owner can accept your offer, or someone else can make a higher offer (which would return your funds to you). If your offer is the highest and the owner does not accept it within 24 hours, you can manually withdraw your offer from escrow, or the owner can accept it at any time.

### **What happens to my funds when I make an offer in a Rolling Auction?**

When you make an offer, your funds go into escrow. If the owner accepts your offer, your funds go to the owner and you receive the NFT. If someone makes a higher offer, your funds are automatically released from escrow. If you have the highest offer but the owner does not accept it within 24 hours, you need to manually withdraw your offer from escrow.

### **How can I withdraw my offer from escrow in a Rolling Auction?**

After an offer you placed unlocks, you can pull back your NEAR from escrow by pressing Withdraw on the Rolling Auction page, or on the My Offers page, which you can find under Manage in the navbar.
