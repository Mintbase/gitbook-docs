1. Upload the main image. This is the thumbnail to what you are selling. Categorize your NFT and say whether it is art, music, news etc. Set price + quantity.

2\. On the button ‘Forever Sound and Videos’ only upload a **teaser of your track** (10–15 seconds). On ‘Forever PDF’ you can upload a pdf which states license agreements if applicable.

3\. On the lock button, upload the whole file. This file will **only be accessible** to whoever buys or owns the NFT. People on Mintbase scrolling through the markets will not be able to listen or view the whole file.
