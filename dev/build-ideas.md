# üí° Build Ideas

### Integrations&#x20;

* Integrate Mintbase NFTs with other web2 platforms like canva, figma, shopify
* Integrate Mintbase NFTs with existing NEAR dapps like [astro](https://app.astrodao.com/dao/mintbase.sputnik-dao.near) or [roketo](https://www.roke.to/), or your own

### Apps&#x20;

* Social (e.g. [minsta](https://www.minsta.me/), mint your photo and the last photographer becomes the owner of the new mints)&#x20;
* Unlockables / Gated Content (e.g. a stock app where only license holders can download assets)
* Create your own minter, market, or redeeming systems that do something unique
* Utilize the NEARCON tickets within your app
* News (utilize permanent web storage for podcasts, video, and news feeds)
* Voting or polling app open to or weighted based on NFT holdings
* Market that only pulls in select stores, gateway for niche markets, example: Only Mintbase stores that are in the Berlin nightclub scene.
* Build your own auction site
* Build a music streaming app, only import NFTs with with the metata/animation\_type = ‚Äúaudio/mpeg‚Äù
* Build a 3d gaming asset app, only import NFTs with with the metata/animation\_type = ‚Äúmodel/gltf-binary‚Äù

### **Wildcard**

* Trigger mintbase js calls from iOT device, maybe bring your DJI drone?&#x20;
* Connecting other Smart contracts in your own creative way Zero knowledge research and implementation
* Identity solutions, not soulbound tokens, we love the transfer function, but validating initial issuance through provenance and KYC leveling for accounts would be fun to dive into.&#x20;
* Up to you, go nuts‚Ä¶

### Research

We need zero knowledge for NFTs on NEAR. Eventually even perceptions should be NFTs where the redeemer should not have to expose their identity to claim.
