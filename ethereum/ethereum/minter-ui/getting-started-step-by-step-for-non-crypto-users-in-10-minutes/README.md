# Getting started

In order to create and sell non-fungible tokens as tickets, photography, services or other assets, you need two pre-requisites:

* [ ] a blockchain wallet (we recommend the browser wallet [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) for newbies)
* [ ] some Ether to cover [gas fees](../ethereum-gas-fee.md) in order to create NFTs. You can swap currencies for ETH quickly with [Wyre](https://pay.sendwyre.com/purchase) to get started. If you do not want to spend any money (ETH) please use our test network [rinkeby.](test-network-rinkeby.mintbase.io.md)

You can only use Mintbase once these two pre-requisites are fulfilled.

&#x20;Please note that you can use the blockchain wallets and currency exchanges as you wish. This is just a step by step guide to simplify user on-boarding. Let's walk you through the process.

## Step 1: Creating a blockchain wallet

Go to [https://metamask.io/](https://metamask.io/) and install MetaMask for your browser. Follow the steps.

Once you are set up, your MetaMask wallet will appear in your browser on the top right (fox)

In order to copy your Ethereum address (which is like a bank account number), click on the hash like in the image (Carobase).

## Step 2: Top up your Ethereum wallet so you can make transactions on Mintbase

Go to [wyre](https://pay.sendwyre.com/purchase). They make it super simple to swap currencies (EUR, USD, etc) against ETH with a credit or debit card.

Make sure you copy the ETH address you copied from your MetaMask wallet above into the field "Send ETH To".

Once confirmed, you sent yourself money to your blockchain wallet. The amount should pop up in your MetaMask.

Please note that if you want to swap ETH back to EUR/USD or other currencies, you can always go to exchanges like [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) or [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/).&#x20;
