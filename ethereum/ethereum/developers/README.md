# Developers

## Four big things to keep in mind

Anything you can do with our interface can be done via code.

### 1. Testing on Rinkeby

UI:  [https://rinkeby.mintbase.io](https://rinkeby.mintbase.io/)

Token Data SubGraph: [https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/nategeier/mint-factory?query=Mintbase](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/nategeier/mint-factory?query=Mintbase)

### 2 Realtime Token Data

If you want to create your own reporting system, get the owner of a token, or build your own realtime interface, use our SubGraph

{% content-ref url="api.md" %}
[api.md](api.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### 3. Web3 Contract Connection

If  you want to have your customers buy an NFT from a Mintbase mint on your own site, transfer tokens, or interact with any of the [ERC-721 functions](https://etherscan.io/token/0x33c8a345830636556160c2ebc3abb90be2e1252b#readContract) connect with a library like [web3js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/) or [ethersJS](https://docs.ethers.io/)

{% content-ref url="contract-connection.md" %}
[contract-connection.md](contract-connection.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}



### 4. Verified Contracts

Every market created on Mintbase is verified immediately on etherscan so you can always pull the ABI directly from etherscan, see the source code, and interact with [all the ERC-721 functions](https://etherscan.io/token/0x33c8a345830636556160c2ebc3abb90be2e1252b#readContract) like this one

### Interact with the smart contract directly on etherscan
