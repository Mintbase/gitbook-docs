# How to list

Listing an NFT means making it available for sale or auction.

There are 3 ways that you can proceed to list an NFT.

## 1. Thing Page

On any Thing Page of an NFT that you own, you will see a bar on top with actions that you can do.

Click **List**

## 2. Navbar - Owned NFTs

If you're looking for NFTs that you own but haven't minted yourself.

On the navbar go to **Create** and **My NFTs**
