# Connecting your Wallet

If your wallet is not connected, you'll see a **Connect Wallet** button in the top right corner of any page on Mintbase.

The green dot next to it, means that you will be connecting your wallet to Mainnet.

## Mainnet VS Testnet

You can use Mintbase on Mainnet or Testnet.

Mainnet is the live, production network where transactions are processed using real funds.

Testnet, on the other hand, is a simulated network for testing purposes. **This means that on Testnet, users are free to test the same features without using real money.**

## Connecting your wallet

After clicking **Connect Wallet**, a modal will pop up where you can choose [any of these crypto wallets.](set-up-a-wallet.md#the-following-wallets-can-be-used-on-mintbase)

The connecting flow may vary a bit depending on the wallet provider.

Regardless of the wallet used, you'll need to authorize the connection to Mintbase with limited access: **Mintbase never has direct access to your funds.**

A screen will appear informing you that up to 0.25 NEAR in Network Fee Allowances can be used by Mintbase. **This amount will never be used without your knowledge.**
