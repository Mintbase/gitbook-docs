# Store profile

Your store's profile is the front page of your smart contract. It's the first thing people will see when they visit your store from anywhere on the marketplace.

You can see different types of information in the store's profile. Let's start at the top. First, there's the [#profile-image](store-settings.md#profile-image "mention") and [#header-image](store-settings.md#header-image "mention") (add these via [store-settings.md](store-settings.md "mention")).&#x20;

You can also see your social media links & the general stats for that store such as number of NFT's minted, total owners or total transaction volume.&#x20;

All NFTs that have been minted on the store will be shown. Users can then decide if they want to show only the ones that are currently listed.

Toggle between NFTs and Minters to see all users that have been added to the smart contract, and who owns it.&#x20;
