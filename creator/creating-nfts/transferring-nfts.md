A modal will pop up in the same page. Here you can input the accounts you want to send to, and how many tokens you want to send to each account.

Your can send up to 100 tokens of the same NFT in a single transaction.

After filling out the accounts and amounts, click **Continue** to be redirected to your wallet and approve the transaction.
