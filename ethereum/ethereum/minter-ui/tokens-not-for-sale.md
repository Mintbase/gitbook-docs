# Tokens Not for Sale

Uncheck the box "is for sale" (bottom right) in order to put it not for sale. When an item is not for sale, no-one can grab the NFT.  As such, you can transfer and airdrop the token to designated people. How to do this is under  ["Transfer/ Airdrop".](transfer-airdrop.md)

You can, after the token has been created, still enable the sale.
