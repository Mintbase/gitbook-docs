# Data Model

Our system was built with the following entities in mind:

1. **Store**: NFT Smart Contract / Decentralized API)
2. **Thing**: Type of NFT
3. **Token:** Single NFT with unique owner

![Store => Thing => Token](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png>)

### Stadium Ticketing Example

Imagine a stadium could be the smart contract

1. _**Store**_ = Stadium
2. _**Thing**_ = VIP section
3. _**Token**_ (Individual Seat with entire price and ownership history)
