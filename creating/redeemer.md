### What is a Redeemer?

When you redeem (or burn) an NFT, you lock it and make it impossible for anything to be done with this token in the future. It is "destroyed" for further use. Although still exists on the blockchain though, you **can't** list it for sale, transfer it or multiply it. It's burnt. Burning tokens will free storage space on your smart contract.

### How to find the redeemer?

Every Store (Smart Contract) on [mintbase.io](https://mintbase.io) comes has it's own redeemer page. When you are viewing a store you will see it like this:\

When clicking on the redeemer you will get confronted with this:&#x20;

You can see which NFT was burnt by whom at what time. You can also search for redeemed tokens per the signer's wallet or token ID. \

It is a self-updating page (every 5 seconds) so displaying a screen at the entrance of an event is a perfect way for staff and customers to see how the mechanism works.&#x20;

### Why does Mintbase offer a redeemer?

Thinking about utility NFTs - like ticketing, sales of physical things, sales of services, sales of certificates - it is important that the given NFT is only used once.

Imagine entering a festival with an NFT-Ticket. Once you are inside, you could easily (especially on NEAR) send it out to someone in the line for them to go in with the same ticket. This is made impossible with the Redeeming mechanism.

When you are entering the festival you will burn your ticket - and it will show on the redeemer.

### Retrieving a Burn QR Code

To have others burn a thing of yours, click "Burn"  then the arrow and either download the QR code or copy the thing URL. This will streamline the process so they will only have to sign. See video above for full instructions.
