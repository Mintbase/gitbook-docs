### Enter the product/ NFT details

Name the NFT and describe what it means (Ticket, Product, Membership) . On the right hand side, you can enter the price and whether your product is for sale or not. You can create up to 25 NFTs at once. You can determine how many products or items you want to create by dragging the bar under "Mint this many". If you are minting a product for sale, please select the "Is for Sale" button and choose a price. Please note that the conversion is fluctuating real-time with the ETH price. If you want to create a free item, unselect the box "Is for Sale".

At the top, you can enter different data like time the NFT is valid, youtube, website or other custom data. This will not appear on your sale on Mintbase, however the so called metadata will appear on OpenSea.

(Ticket, Product, Membership)&#x20;
