## Get an API Key

For most operations moving forward an API key will be required.

Register a [developer key here](https://www.mintbase.io/developer)

## Mintbase SDK

Each tool in our SDK ("Mintbase JS") allows you read and write information to and from the blockchain.

**Reading** the data written to chain can be queried via [GraphQL Schemas](dev/read-data/mintbase-graph.md) or our new [Indexer APIs](mintbase-sdk-ref/packages/data/src/api/README.md).

**Writing** transactions like minting, transferring, listing and buying is done through [Mintbase JS](mintbase-sdk-ref/packages/sdk/README.md) which produce transactions via our [Smart Contracts](dev/smart-contracts/README.md)

## Examples Repository

Get building fast with our pre built [examples](dev/examples.md).

Each one is a dapp starting point that can be configured and deployed to your own github.

* [Simple Minter](https://github.com/Mintbase/examples/blob/main/simple-minter)
