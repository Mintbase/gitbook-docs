# Overview

## Introduction

GM. We are not just another NFT marketplace, we are here to get you to build your own minter, market, and NFT redeeming systems. The future is niche markets, operated by you on sharded, decentralized, green POS chains (now on [NEAR](https://near.org/)).

Less talk, more building.

1. For [Creators](creating/store/) (Website UI) _NEAR_
2. For [Developers](dev/getting-started.md) (Build your own Mintbase)&#x20;
3. For [Ethereum Users](ethereum/ethereum/minter-ui/)

### Testing Before: Testnet üêô

You can use the entire system both on the interface and via code using testnet at [https://testnet.mintbase.io](https://testnet.mintbase.io/)

This is a playground where you can use the NEAR blockchain just as you would on mainnet with real funds.

When you create a NEAR account on login, it will automatically give you 200N so you can interact with everything including sending NFTs to other testnet users. You can send Nate some to _**mint.testnet**_&#x20;
