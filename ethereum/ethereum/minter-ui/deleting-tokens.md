# Burning Tokens

If you want to delete your items that you minted, go to the "Builder" page and you can simply click the "X" at the top right corner of your image. You will have to confirm with your wallet. _Once the tokens are burned, you cannot get them back! This one burned your own tokens and will not burn others that have already bought or been transferred._
