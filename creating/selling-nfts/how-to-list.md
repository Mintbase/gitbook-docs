# How to list

Listing an NFT means making it available for sale or auction.

There are 3 ways that you can proceed to list an NFT.

## 1. Thing Page

On any Thing Page of an NFT that you own, you will see a bar on top with actions that you can do.

Click **List**

## 2. Navbar - Owned NFTs

If you're looking for NFTs that you own but haven't minted yourself.

On the navbar go to **Create** and **My NFTs**

Find the NFT you want to sell and click **List**

## After doing any of these steps

You can choose to [List as Simple Sale](listing-as-simple-sale.md) or [List as Rolling Auction](listing-as-rolling-auction.md)

## Storage Deposits

When you list a token for sale on Mintbase, you will be asked to deposit 0.01N _per token_ listed into the market contract. This deposit is required by NEAR protocol and **is not a Mintbase fee. The deposit will be refunded to you when a token is sold or the listing is removed.** &#x20;

For more details regarding storage deposits on NEAR [read this section or our FAQ](../faq.md#what-is-a-storage-deposit-and-why-is-it-required-to-list-on-the-market)
