# DAOs & the Mintbase Toolkit

Everything you do on Mintbase, you can also do via a DAO on [AstroDAO](https://app.astrodao.com/):

* Create a store (=deploy a smart contract)
* \[batch] add / remove minters
* \[batch] mint NFTs&#x20;
* \[batch] transfer NFTs&#x20;
* \[batch] list NFTs for simple sale
* \[batch] list NFTs for auction
* \[batch] burn NFTs

This can be done via custom function calls that will trigger the action as soon as the last vote is approved.&#x20;

**How to create a custom function call on AstroDAO?**

When you go to app.astrodao.com and select any DAO â€” we will be using the [MintbaseDAO](https://app.astrodao.com/dao/mintbase.sputnik-dao.near) as an example here - click on the green plus sign. There, click **Proposal**.&#x20;

This will open another window with **Propose a Transfer** as the default setting. Click on **Propose a Transfer** and search for **Function Call.**&#x20;

To do anything via your DAO - you need to **add your DAO as a minter** to an existing store - or **create the store via the DAO**.&#x20;

Doing things via the DAO will pull funds from the DAO instead of the individual user. It is a decentralised, transparent way of managing digital assets for DAOs.

If you're looking to know more, we published an article about this with the itty gritty details of each action: [check it out here.](https://blog.mintbase.io/cfcs-mintbase-astrodao-4c01b47bfa4c)
