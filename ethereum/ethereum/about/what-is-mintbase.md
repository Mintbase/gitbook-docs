# What is Mintbase?

[Mintbase](https://mintbase.io/) is a global platform and marketplace - like Amazon.&#x20;

It allows anyone, including those with less technical backgrounds, to create their own digital assets verified on multiple blockchains. Mintbase provides users (minters) with various creative allocation and redemption mechanisms for their customers.

This means that you can offer, buy and sell your items. Unlike Amazon, you can also sell your items on other digital exchanges. Mintbase allows you to create scarce, interoperable and unique digital items via [non-fungible tokens (NFTs)](../general-blockchain-questions/non-fungible-token.md).&#x20;
