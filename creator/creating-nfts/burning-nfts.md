# Burning NFTs

To burn an NFT, is to erase it. This has multiple use cases, like redeeming tickets for a concert. When entering the concert you would burn your ticket.

**Important:** once you burn your token it will be destroyed and you will have no way to recover it.

On the navbar go to **Create** and click on **My Stores** or **My NFTs**

**My Stores:** Go here to find NFTs that you have minted on your contract

**My NFTs:** Go here to find all your owned NFTs, including the ones that you have bought or received from other sources

A modal will pop up in the same page. Here you can input the amount of tokens you want to burn.

After filling out the burn amount, click **Continue** to be redirected to your wallet to approve the transaction.

## QR Code Builder

You can also create and download a QR code to burn your NFT directly from this page. This makes it easier to set up IRL redeeming systems - think tickets, membersâ€™ access, or physical objects.

### How does it work?

**Download QR Code**

When you click on **Download QR Code** you will download a QR Code that when scanned, will prompt the person to burn this NFT. This will only be possible if she owns a token of this NFT.



**Copy Deeplink**

Same principle as above, but instead of getting a QR Code you get a link.
