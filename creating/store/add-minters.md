# Add Minters

You can add minters to your store if you are the owner (the account that deployed the contract).&#x20;

1. Go to "Create"
2. Find your store in the drop down (If you own multiple stores)
3. Settings
4. Add Minters (Enter near account)
5. On green checkmark click "grant" and confirm the transaction.
6. The user will show in the list  of "Active Minters" and will see this store as you do when they log in.&#x20;

The added minters will only be able to see their own mints and this applies to you as well. Any listed items will show jointly in the store view.
