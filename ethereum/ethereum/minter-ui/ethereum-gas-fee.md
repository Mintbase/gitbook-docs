# Ethereum Gas Fee

When minting or creating items on Mintbase, we make use of the Ethereum blockchain. The gas fee is the price the creator has to pay and varies according to the network traffic (clog).

The average **gas price** is typically on the order of about 8 Gwei. However it can increase during times of high **network** traffic as there are more transactions competing to be included in the next block.&#x20;

We recommend our users to not mint tokens when the gas price is above 12 Gwei to wait until the price goes down. In order to check the price of the gas fee, simply check on MetaMask when creating a smart contract or on [ETH gas station](https://ethgasstation.info/).

When the network experiences high traffic, the gas fee goes up and it will be more expensive to create stores and NFTs. Recently, the gas fee has been extraordinary high and for that reason, Mintbase will be adding [NEAR](https://medium.com/mintbase/scaling-mintbase-with-near-503375d92702) as another blockchain additionally to Ethereum. On NEAR, it will be more affordable and scalable for people to create and trade NFTs.
