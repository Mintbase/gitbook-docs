## Mintbase JS

MintbaseJS is a library created to lower the barrier to entry for decentralized application development on the NEAR ecosystem as well as facilitating integrations with Mintbase systems.



Or use our [boilerplate examples](../examples.md) to deploy your own market in minutes.

## Quick Start

* [Add Wallet Connection To Your React App](add-wallet-connection-to-your-react-app.md)
* [Make Your First Contract Call (deployContract)](make-your-first-contract-call-deploycontract.md)
* [Upload Reference Material To Arweave and Mint](upload-reference-material-to-arweave-and-mint.md)
* [Get Blockchain Data (ownedTokens)](get-blockchain-data-ownedtokens.md)

## Modules

With our tools, **it is possible to cover all points of token blockchain app development.** For that, we focused on these 4 themes.\


### [@mintbase-js/sdk](./#mintbase-js-sdk)

Easily deploy a ready-to-use token contract from Mintbase and interact with it in a few lines of code. Curate your own market by listing, buying and selling on Mintbase markets with affiliate bonuses.&#x20;

### ****[**@mintbase-js/react**](./#mintbase-js-react)****

Out-of-the-box wallet integration with our react wallet selector wrapper.

### ****[**@mintbase-js/storage**](../../mintbase-sdk-ref/packages/storage/)****

Easily upload your source material to Arweave where it will be permanently stored to be used in minting.

### [@mintbase-js/data](../../mintbase-sdk-ref/packages/data/)

Get general [data from the blockchain in a few lines of code](../../mintbase-sdk-ref/packages/data/) or use our [GraphQl indexer](../read-data/mintbase-graph.md) to make your own custom queries.&#x20;

## [Use Case Examples](../examples.md)

Get building fast with our pre-built examples.

Each one of these examples covers a use case we believe is strongly supported by our SDK.

Below you can find a dapp starting point that can be configured and deployed to your own github in 10 minutes.
