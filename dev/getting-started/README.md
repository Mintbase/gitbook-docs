# ðŸ›  Getting Started

### GraphQL Indexer

[All read-only graphQL](./#graphql-indexer) data generated from blockchain transactions happen here. It's how we know who ones what tokens with what royalties quickly.

### Rust Contracts

* [Main Repo](https://github.com/Mintbase/mb-contracts)
* [Market](https://github.com/Mintbase/mb-contracts/tree/main/mb-interop-market) with USDC listings
* [NEP171 NFT contract](https://github.com/Mintbase/mb-contracts/tree/main/mb-store), we call a store
* [Factory](https://github.com/Mintbase/mb-contracts/tree/main/mb-factory) to recreate stores (Mintbase has deployed over 1,400 on NEAR)
* [Audits](https://arweave.net/WvB-T\_sg6HbpG08NLutna0bw65hq4tkZZoUJzw4iRK4)

### MintbaseJS

[MintbaseJS](https://github.com/Mintbase/mintbase-js) is a library created to lower the barrier to entry for decentralized application development on the NEAR ecosystem and facilitate integrations with Mintbase systems.

All transitions made on Mintbase.xyz are done with MintbaseJS, mint, transfer, burn, buy, list...

Or use our boilerplate templates to deploy your own market in minutes.



### Quick Start

* [Add Wallet Connection To Your React App](add-wallet-connection-to-your-react-app.md)
* [Make Your First Contract Call (deployContract)](make-your-first-contract-call-deploycontract.md)
* [Upload Reference Material To Arweave and Mint](upload-reference-material-to-arweave-and-mint.md)
* [Get Blockchain Data (ownedTokens)](get-blockchain-data-ownedtokens.md)



### Modules

With our tools, **it is possible to cover all points of token blockchain app development.** For that, we focused on these 4 themes.\


### [@mintbase-js/sdk](./#mintbase-js-sdk)

Easily deploy a ready-to-use token contract from Mintbase and interact with it in a few lines of code. Curate your own market by listing, buying and selling on Mintbase markets with affiliate bonuses.&#x20;

### [**@mintbase-js/react**](./#mintbase-js-react)

Out-of-the-box wallet integration with our react wallet selector wrapper.

### [**@mintbase-js/storage**](../../mintbase-sdk-ref/packages/storage/)

Easily upload your source material to Arweave where it will be permanently stored to be used in minting.

### [@mintbase-js/data](../../mintbase-sdk-ref/packages/data/)

Get general [data from the blockchain in a few lines of code](../../mintbase-sdk-ref/packages/data/) or use our [GraphQl indexer](../read-data/mintbase-graph.md) to make your own custom queries.&#x20;
