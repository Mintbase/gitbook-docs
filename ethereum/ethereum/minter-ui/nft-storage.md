# NFT File Size

We currently allow our users to upload the main image up to 10 MB.&#x20;

The other files  have a maximum file size of 16 MB (pdf, ogg, mp4, mp3).

We support PNG, gif, jpeg, pdf, ogg, mp3, mp4.&#x20;

We recommend our users to use a 1:1 RATIO for their images. The reason for that is that  squares work best on all ERC-721 wallets. Ultimately, the point of a NFT is that is  is interoperable and can be displayed on different dapps and wallets.
