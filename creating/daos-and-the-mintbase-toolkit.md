# DAOs & the Mintbase Toolkit

Everything you do on Mintbase - you can do via a DAO at [AstroDAO](https://app.astrodao.com/).

* Create store (smart contract)
* \[batch] add / remove minters
* \[batch] mint NFTs&#x20;
* \[batch] transfer NFTs&#x20;
* \[batch] list NFTs for simple sale
* \[batch] list NFTs for auction
* \[batch] burn NFTs

How? You'll create custom function calls that will trigger an action as soon as the last vote is approved.&#x20;

**How to create a custom function call on AstroDAO?**

When you go to app.astrodao.com and select any DAO — we will be using the [MintbaseDAO](https://app.astrodao.com/dao/mintbase.sputnik-dao.near) as an example here, you will be confronted with the following visual

Clicking on the green plus will open another window which is by default: **Propose a Transfer.**

We do not want to propose transfer now — we are looking into CUSTOM FUNCTION CALLS — which is the last option when clicking on “Propose a Transfer”.

When you click custom function call you will see this template:

## We published an article about this with the itty gritty details of each action: [check it out here.](https://blog.mintbase.io/cfcs-mintbase-astrodao-4c01b47bfa4c)

To do anything via your DAO - you need to **add your DAO as a minter** to an existing store - or **create the store via the DAO**.&#x20;

Doing things via the DAO will pull funds from the DAO instead of the individual user. It is a decentralised, transparent way of managing the Daos' digital assets.
