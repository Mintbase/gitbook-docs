# Listing NFTs

After having [minted](minting-nfts.md) your NFT, you can set it for sale.

In the Create tab, click on **List** button under the NFT you want to set for sale.

Now you are in Listing page. Currently the only option is Simple Sale, we are actively developing Rolling Auction.

### Simple Sale

You set a fixed price and anyone can buy it.

#### Amount to list

This first input is the amount of tokens you wish to list. In the example above, the NFT has 5 tokens that you could list.

If you want, you could list each one at a different price, leaving "1" in this field, and making 5 listings.

#### Price

Type the price in NEAR of your token (price of each one, if you were to list multiple at once).



That's it! After filling these 2 fields press **Make Listing**, sign the transaction in the NEAR interface and you will see a success page. After that, your listing will be visible in the Marketplace.



#### Important

Today we don't have a feature to unlist a token. **If you do a new listing of a token that is already listed, it will override the old listing.**
