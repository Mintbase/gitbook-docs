# Test Network (Rinkeby.mintbase.io)

The rinkeby test network allows you to test Mintbase without spending money. You first need a [blockchain wallet](./) and fake test money to get started. You can request that [here](https://faucet.rinkeby.io/) or watch the video "[Rinkeby ETH](requesting-fake-eth-rinkeby.md)". Also, you can switch the network in your blockchain wallet to the test network.
