## What next Mintbase?

We believe in a world of anti-upload filters and anti-censorship to a degree. This is the reason we have been careful on opening up our market as an automatic public option, but the reality is that blockchain is hard. When you mint, does the image show up on the confirmation of that transaction? Yes? Excellent, we accomplished the bare minimum and we'll improve our dapp as we go. We just had a major update moving our contracts from a random dispatches, losing some contracts into the ether to a very organized verified contract factory (theGraph). Now that we have this factory design sorted, we feel we are ready to start tackling this beautiful immutable `data` problem. &#x20;
