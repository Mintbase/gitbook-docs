# ðŸ§  Introduction

Anything we've built on Mintbase, (minter, market, auction, airdrop, redeemer) you can build yourself, and we are pushing to make this easier every day.

1. We are using the [NEAR Protocol](https://near.org/).&#x20;
2. We have designed our data model aiming to help scaling projects.&#x20;
   1. [(Data) Store => Thing => Token](read-data/data-model/)&#x20;
3. Use [MintbaseJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mintbase) for any transactions (writing data to chain)&#x20;
4. Use our [GraphQL indexer](read-data/mintbase-graph.md) to get realtime chain data (who owns what)
5. There is a full [testnet](https://testnet.mintbase.io/) environment for testing ui, indexer, and transactions
6. Our Smart Contracts are [open-sourced](https://github.com/Mintbase/mintbase-core/tree/master/store)
