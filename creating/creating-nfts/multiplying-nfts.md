# Multiplying NFTs

To multiply an NFT is to mint more tokens of the same NFT

{% hint style="info" %}
You can only Multiply NFTs that you have minted, and not all NFTs that you own.
{% endhint %}

On the navbar go to **Create** and **My Stores**

Find the NFT you want and click **Multiply**

A modal will pop up in the same page. Here you can input the amount you wish to mint.

After clicking **Continue** you will be redirected to your wallet to approve the transaction.

Once you approve, you will see the success page and your tokens are minted.
