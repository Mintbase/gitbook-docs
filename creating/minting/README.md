# Launchpad

The Launchpad tab is where you perform all your actions on the NFTs from your stores, or from other stores where you are a minter. These actions can be things like minting, listing, sending, burning an NFT, and so on.

To access it, click on **Launchpad** on the navbar.

On the **tabs** (top left) you can switch between Your Stores or Owned NFTs.

### Your Stores

This is where you manage all of your smart contracts aka stores. You can start by selecting the store you want to work on and perform actions such as view store, change [store settings](../store/store-settings.md), [mint an NFT](minting-nfts.md), access the [redeemer page](../redeemer.md) of that specific store or [deploy a new store](../store/deploy-fee.md).

### Owned NFTs

Besides this, on the Owned NFTs field you have direct access to your NFTs, where you can burn, list or transfer tokens you own.&#x20;
