# Smart Contract

## **What is a smart contract?**

A smart contract is a function or algorithm that is automatically carried out by a computer system in a trackable and irreversible manner, often on a blockchain. A smart contract has the aim to digitally facilitate and enforce the negotiation and performance of a contract.&#x20;

The most popular contracts are built on the Ethereum standard, ERC-20 Token, mostly for its mass usage and high level of security.
