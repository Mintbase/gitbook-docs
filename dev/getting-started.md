## Get an API Key

For most operations moving forward an API key is required.

Register a [developer key here](https://www.mintbase.io/developer)

## Mintbase SDK

Each tool in our SDK ("Mintbase JS") allows you read and write data to the blockchain.

### **Reading** NFT data is done using our [GraphQL Schemas](dev/read-data/mintbase-graph.md) or our new [Indexer API](mintbase-sdk-ref/packages/data/src/api/README.md).

### **Writing** and moving data to perform actions like minting, transferring, listing and buying is done through [Mintbase JS](mintbase-sdk-ref/packages/sdk/README.md)



## Examples Repository

Our examples repository automatically deploys a Mintbase integrated dapp to your own github, ready to build on and deploy.

* [Simple Marketplace](https://github.com/Mintbase/examples/blob/main/simple-marketplace)
* [Simple Minter](https://github.com/Mintbase/examples/blob/main/simple-minter)
