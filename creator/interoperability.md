# ðŸ”„ Interoperability

## What is interoperability

Web2 infrastructure is centralized and all your data, connections and general internet services are managed by a few big tech companies.

Web3 is based around blockchain technology and works in a more decentralized and public manner, where we try to always achieve **interoperability.**



**Interoperability** is the highway connecting all the different platforms on the Web3 universe.



Everything you do on Mintbase is on the NEAR blockchain using **NEP-171** token standard.&#x20;

So if any other platform on NEAR uses the same standard you can use and perform actions with your tokens there, and vice versa.



### Mintbase Contracts and External Contracts

Every contract deployed on Mintbase is it's own dapp. This means you can even find it on [DappRadar](https://dappradar.com/nft/protocol/near). Other marketplaces work in different ways, and your usually minting on a contract that is not your own.



### Mintbase Tokens and External Tokens

Similarly, the actions you can perform on Mintbase vary depending if it's and Mintbase or external token.



#### Payouts vs Royalties & Splits

External tokens don't have Royalties & Splits like Mintbase tokens.

Instead they have a single Payout option, which works just like Royalties.

The wallets listed there will receive these percentages whenever the token get sold, forever.



#### Media Not Available

This happens because of the way the media is stored.
