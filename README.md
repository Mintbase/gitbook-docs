description: What can I do with Mintbase?

# Overview

The only fully automated Minter + Marketplace on NEAR that helps you create and list NFTs on your own smart contract with a full developer suite to enable you to build your own stand alone market and NFT systems.

## Where do I start?

1\. If you are a [creator](creator/getting-started/), then you will find our website interface the most intuitive way to get started.

2\. For [developers](dev/getting-started/) ready to build their own Mintbase the getting started section of our docs is your starting point.

## Using Testnet

Like most blockchains, NEAR requires a native token to process transactions which has real value, and therefore cost.

Throughout your Mintbase journey, you can always use testnet to carry out experiments.

To get started and receive 200N in your test wallet, sign up at [wallet.testnet.near.org](https://wallet.testnet.near.org/)

You can use the entire system both on the interface and via code using testnet at [https://testnet.mintbase.io](https://testnet.mintbase.io/)

This is a playground where you can use the NEAR blockchain just as you would on mainnet with real funds.
