### Done!



### Sold Something?

To see if you sold something, just go back to the Stripe Beta tab. Payouts go out at the end of the day and take up to 5 business days to eventually show up in your bank account. Yes, we know crypto is instant and better, but baby steps to mass adoption.

If you click "See Payments," it will securly log you into your Stripe account to see all the payment records in action. Mintbase does not have access to your Stripe account.

### The Future

We want to roll this out slowly to abide by [Stripe's terms of service](https://stripe.com/en-gb-pt/legal/ssa), but eventually, we look to open it up to all.
