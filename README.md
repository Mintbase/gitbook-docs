# Welcome to Mintbase


### We are not just an NFT marketplace.

With mintbase, you can **build your own minter, market, and NFT redeeming systems** that support the next evolutions in web commerce.

## What is an NFT?

An NFT consists of two main parts:

1. A unique identifier a blockchain can use to track ownership between user accounts.

2. A pointer to what we call metadata. This pointer does not have to live on the blockchain.

When you mint an NFT using Mintbase (or another NEAR token contract), you will be creating metadata and letting the token contract know that this new record exists. Now, it can be transferred, listed and sold anywhere in the NEAR ecosystem.

## Let's do this! Where do I start?

### 1. If you are a [creator](creating/store/) then you will find our website interface the most intuitive way to get started.
### 2. For [developers](dev/getting-started.md) ready to build their own Mintbase the getting started section of our docs is your starting point.

## Using Testnet

Like most blockchains, NEAR requires a native token to process transactions which has real value, and therefore cost.

Throughout your Mintbase journey, you can always use testnet to carry out experiments.

To get started and receive 200N in your test wallet, sign up at [wallet.testnet.near.org](https://wallet.testnet.near.org/)

You can use the entire system both on the interface and via code using testnet at [https://testnet.mintbase.io](https://testnet.mintbase.io/)

This is a playground where you can use the NEAR blockchain just as you would on mainnet with real funds.
