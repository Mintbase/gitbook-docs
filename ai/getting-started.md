Only use an account with a low balance and always check the amount of funds each transaction generates.  Also, make sure to check the trade details before submitting.

Anything you can do on Mintbase, you can do on our prompts, mint, generate images, using DALL-E 3 list, buy, deploy NFT contract, and now DeFi swaps. Show us your prompts using the X hashtag #bitte

See a prompt in action [here](https://wallet.mintbase.xyz/smart-actions/XeCzN\_PZGW4eoWnhSQW5L)

If you own your own NFT smart contract, you can always add "_mint on my contract xxx.mintbase1.near_" to most of these prompts vs. minting on open contracts. You can [Deploy your own NFT contract on Mintbase here](https://www.mintbase.xyz/) or do [it with AI](create-my-contract.md)
