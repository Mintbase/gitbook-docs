# Set up a Wallet

Mintbase operates on the [NEAR blockchain](https://near.org/) and to interact with the system you will need a crypto wallet. Wallets are used for asset management and to authorize transactions.

### The following Wallets can be used on Mintbase:

* [NEAR Wallet](https://wallet.near.org/)
* [Meteor Wallet](https://meteorwallet.app/)
* [MyNearWallet](https://app.mynearwallet.com/)
* [Sender Wallet](https://senderwallet.io/)

You can conduct research and select a preferred wallet. You will be using your wallet on Mintbase all the time, to authorize any transaction. So choosing a wallet with a nice user experience and that works on all your devices is important.

After installing the wallet application or browser extension, follow the instructions to set up a new wallet.
