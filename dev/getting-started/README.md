Before jumping into the technical details itâ€™s important to understand that:

1. We are using the [NEAR Protocol](https://near.org/).&#x20;
2. Anything our main application does ([mintbase.io](https://mintbase.io)), you can also do in yours. Your own minter, market, auction system, redeemer, etc.&#x20;
3. We have designed our data model aiming to help scaling projects.&#x20;
   1. [(Data) Store => Thing => Token](../data-and-indexer/data-model/)&#x20;
4. Knowing how to write GraphQL queries might come in handy. You can query all the data from our indexer databases (DBs), no limits.&#x20;
5. We have a JS SDK ([MintbaseJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mintbase)) to help you make transactions that interact with smart contracts on NEAR.&#x20;
6. There is a [testnet](https://testnet.mintbase.io/) environment for testing features.&#x20;
7. Our Smart Contracts are [open-sourced](https://github.com/Mintbase/mintbase-core/tree/master/store).
