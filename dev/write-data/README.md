# ğŸ–Š Write Data

When we write to a blockchain, we are making a transaction. Any transaction we do on Mintbse (mint, burn, transfer, and make offer) you can do either talking directly to the contract via NEAR CLI , [MintbaseJS](mintbasejs.md), or ever using a ui tool like [Nearblocks](https://nearblocks.io/address/nearcon2.mintbase1.near#contract)
